# PCB Preflight API - Sandbox Sample Files
The PCB Preflight API sandbox includes sample files that permit developers to freely test and perform simulated responses - at no charge.


## Sandbox File Description
* `sandbox-274x_board1.zip` A set of 274X Gerber files for a traditional 2-layer PCB design.
* `sandbox-274x_board4.zip` Another set of 274X Gerber files for a traditional 2-layer PCB design.
* `sandbox-274x_gerbers.zip` A set of 274X Gerber files for a very old 4-layer PCB design.
* `sandbox-x3_gerbers.zip` A set of X3 Gerber files for a large area 4-layer PCB design.
* `sandbox-274x_net_check.zip` A set of 274X Gerber files for a 4-layer PCB design. Includes an IPC Netlist file (IPC-D-356/B) commonly used for electrical testing.
* `sandbox-odb_wifi.tgz` A simple ODB++ file for a small 4-layer PCB design.
* `sandbox-odb_pc4.tgz` A typical ODB++ file for an 8-layer PCB design.
* `sandbox-odb_pc4_revb.tgz` A revised ODB++ file for an 8-layer PCB design with modifications. Use to compare against `sandbox-odb_pc4.tgz`
